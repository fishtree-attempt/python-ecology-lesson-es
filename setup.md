> ## Software
> [Python](http://python.org) is a popular language for
> scientific computing, and great for general-purpose programming as
> well.  Installing all of its scientific packages individually can be
> a bit difficult, so we recommend an all-in-one installer.
>
> For this workshop we use Python version 3.x.
>
> ### Required Python Packages for this workshop
>
> * [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
> * [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/)
> * [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
> * [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

## Install the workshop packages

For installing these packages we will use Anaconda or Miniconda.
They both use [Conda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/), the main difference is
that Anaconda comes with a lot of packages pre-installed.
With Miniconda you will need to install the required packages.

### Anaconda installation

Anaconda will install the workshop packages for you.

#### Download and install Anaconda

Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).
Remember to download and install the installer for Python 3.x.

#### Download plotting package

The plotting package plotnine is not installed by default.  From the terminal,
type:

~~~
conda install -c conda-forge plotnine
~~~
{: .language-python}

### Miniconda installation

Miniconda is a "light" version of Anaconda. If you install and use Miniconda
you will also need to install the workshop packages.

#### Download and install Miniconda

Download and install [Miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html)
following the instructions. Remember to download and run the installer for
Python 3.x.

#### Check the installation of Miniconda

From the terminal, type:

~~~
conda list
~~~
{: .language-bash}

### Install the required workshop packages with conda

From the terminal, type:

~~~
conda install -y numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter
conda install -c conda-forge plotnine
~~~
{: .language-bash}

## Launch a Jupyter notebook

After installing either Anaconda or Miniconda and the workshop packages,
launch a Jupyter notebook by typing this command from the terminal:

~~~
jupyter notebook
~~~
{: .language-bash}

The notebook should open automatically in your browser. If it does not or you
wish to use a different browser, open this link: <http://localhost:8888>.
